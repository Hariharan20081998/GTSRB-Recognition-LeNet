# GTSRB Recognition
## Dataset
The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. 

The benchmark has the following properties:
1. Single-image, multi-class classification problem
2. More than 40 classes
3. More than 50,000 images in total
4. Large, lifelike database

## Model
The GTSRB Dataset has been classified using the LeNet 5 Architecture.
LeNet-5 CNN architecture is made up of 7 layers. The layer composition consists of 3 convolutional layers, 2 subsampling layers and 2 fully connected layers.
